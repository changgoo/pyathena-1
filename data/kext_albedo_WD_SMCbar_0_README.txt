Extinction, scattering, and absorption properties computed for the
carbonaceous - silicate dust model of Weingartner & Draine (2001) and
Li & Draine (2001).

Model consists of mixture of carbonaceous grains, and amorphous
silicate grains.  Carbonaceous grains are PAH-like when small, and
graphite-like when large (see Li & Draine 2001).  Size distributions
from Weingartner & Draine (2001).  PAH optical properties are from Li
& Draine (2001).  Graphite and silicate optical properties from Draine
& Lee (1984), Laor & Draine (1993), Weingartner & Draine (2001), and
Li & Draine (2001).

Grain size distribution: Weingartner & Draine (2001) model for
"SMC bar" dust with C/H = b_C = 0 in two log-normal size
distributions.

The PAH/graphitic grains in the size distribution given by eq. (5,6)
of Weingartner & Draine (2001) are assumed to be 100% ionized.

Tabulated quantities:
lambda  = wavelength in vacuo (micron)
albedo  = (scattering cross section)/(extinction cross section)
g       = <cos(theta)> for scattered light
C_ext/H = extinction cross section per H nucleon (cm^2/H)
K_abs   = absorption cross section per mass of dust (cm^2/gram)

 3.506E-27 = M_dust per H nucleon (gram/H) for this dust model
 6.669E+02 = M_gas/M_dust for this dust model
